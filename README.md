# What is this?

This is a React app that provides quizzes to help people learning Hebrew with Kutz and Josberger's book "Learning Biblical Hebrew"

# Background

There are many great online resources for learning modern languages. However, my experience is online resources for helping people to learn ancient languages are lacking.

# Goals of this project

This project intends to provide tools that augment textbooks such as "Learning Biblical Hebrew". The project will provide things such as:

1. Parsing quizzes that will have students indicate how a given word ought to be parsed
2. Vocabulary quizzies that will help students recall definitions
3. Translation exercises where students will translate Hebrew into English and vice-versa.
